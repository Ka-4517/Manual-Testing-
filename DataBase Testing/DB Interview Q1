1) What is Database Testing?
Database Testing is also known as Backend Testing.
Database Testing is segmented into four different categories:
Testing of Data Integrity
Testing of Data Validity
Data base related performance
Testing of functions, procedure and triggers

2) In database testing, what do we need to check normally?
Normally, the things that we check in DB Testing are:
Constraint Check
Validation of a Field size
Stored procedure
Matching application field size to database
Indexes for performance based issues

3) Explain what is data driven test?
In a data-table, to test the multi numbers of data, data-driven test is used. 
By using this it can easily replace the parameters at the same time from different locations.


) What are joins and mention different types of joins?
Join is used to display two or more than two table and the types of joins are:
Natural Join
Inner Join
Outer Join
Cross Join
The outer join is divided again in two:
Left outer join
Right outer join


5) What are indexes and mention different types of indexes?
Indexes are database objects and they are created on columns. To fetch data quickly they are frequently accessed. 
Different types of indexes are:
B-Tree index
Bitmap index
Clustered index
Covering index
Non-unique index
Unique index

6) While testing stored procedures what are the steps does a tester takes?
The tester will check the standard format of the stored procedures and also it checks the fields are correct like updates, 
joins, indexes, deletions as mentioned in the stored procedure.
