MySQL is a widely used relational database management system (RDBMS).
MySQL is free and open-source.
MySQL is ideal for both small and large applications.

The MySQL SELECT Statement:
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.
SELECT Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;


The MySQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement:
The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.


The MySQL WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

The MySQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.
ND Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

OR Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

NOT Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;
