MySQL ORDER BY Keyword:
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword. 
ORDER BY Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
ex: SELECT department,id From Employees ORDER BY department DESC|ASC;

The MySQL INSERT INTO Statement:
The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
--
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);


What is a NULL Value?
A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

IS NOT NULL Syntax:
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

The IS NULL Operator
Tip: Always use IS NULL to look for NULL values.
The IS NULL operator is used to test for empty values (NULL values).

The MySQL UPDATE Statement:
The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
UPDATE Syntax:
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

**Update Warning!
Be careful when updating records. If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated!


The MySQL DELETE Statement:
The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

DELETE|DROP|TRUNCATE

DROP
