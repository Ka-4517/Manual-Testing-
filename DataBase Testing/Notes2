Fetching all rows from a table
You can choose columns from a table. To do so, list the names of the desired table columns after SELECT in the statement. 
You give the name of the table after the FROM clause. To retrieve data from a child table, use dot notation, such as parent.child.
Example 1: Choose all data from the table BaggageInfo.
SELECT * FROM BaggageInfo;
Example 2: Fetch column data from Table Customers.
SELECT customer_id FROM Customers;
Example 2: To choose specific column(s) from the table BaggageInfo, include the column names as a comma-separated list in the SELECT statement.
SELECT customer_id,first_name,country FROM Customers  ;

Filter data from a table
You can filter query results by specifying a filter condition in the WHERE clause. Typically, a filter condition consists of one or more comparison expressions connected through logical operators AND or OR. 
SELECT bag.fullName, bag.bagInfo[].tagNum FROM BaggageInfo bag
WHERE bag.confNo="FH7G1W"
