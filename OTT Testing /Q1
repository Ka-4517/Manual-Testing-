1. What is OTT Testing ? 
OTT testing refers to assessing the OTT platform to ensure the quality of streamed content, performance (buffering behavior), and 
compatibility with different devices. It focuses on testing different parameters, such as streaming speed, buffering, audio and 
video quality, security, device compatibility, network speed, and connectivity.

The primary objective of OTT testing is to ensure end-users receive an optimal experience with extremely high-quality OTT 
content on different devices. It assists developers in understanding how a specific OTT platform will function in the real world. 

Testers and QA professionals prioritize testing the streaming platform’s user interface and user experience. 

User Interface: It involves checking the app’s front-end elements and controls to ensure seamless user interaction. 
User Experience: It involves verifying that the app provides optimal performance and exceptional viewing experience 
so that users can’t resist using it repeatedly.

OTT testing is generally a time-consuming process that requires and is carried out as a combination of manual and automation testing.

5.5 Types of OTT Programming
Various OTT services cater to user preferences and business models.
Subscription Video-on-Demand (SVOD) Services: These platforms offer a subscription-based model, granting users access to a content library for a recurring fee.
Advertising-based Video-on-Demand (AVOD) Services: In AVOD services, users can access content for free, supported by advertisements displayed during playback.
Ad and Non-Advertising Supported Services: Some OTT platforms offer ad-supported and non-ad-supported options, allowing users to enjoy content with or without interruptions.
Free Video-on-Demand (VOD): These services allow users to access content without subscription or payment, relying on advertising revenue as their primary monetization method.
Transactional Video-on-Demand (TVOD): TVOD services enable users to rent or purchase individual content on a pay-per-view basis.

6. TV devices ?
Smart TV : a smart TV is a TV set that can deliver content over the Internet. So any TV that offers online content — no matter what operating system it runs — is a smart TV. (QLED 4K Smart TV)
LFD TV : large format displays, or LFDs, are large flat-screen displays that are minimally 32” and can be as big as 90” or more! (SamsunG-DC32E-32-Full HD-16×7 || Samsung-DB43J-43-Full HD-16*7)
Android TV : Android TV is also a smart TV, the major difference being that it runs Android TV OS under the hood.(Sony X800H)
In essence, Android TV and Smart TV are fundamentally the same thing since both offer content over the Internet. 
As I mentioned above, it’s the underlying OS that makes all the difference.
LED TV :LED TV is a type of LCD TV that uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to illuminate the screen, 
LCD TV:while LCD TV uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) or other types of fluorescent lights.
OLED TV:organic light-emitting diode display is a type of display technology that utilizes organic compounds to emit light when an electric current is applied.


7. Performance Testing of OTT Includes?
Response time in different networks (Wi-Fi/3G/4G/5G)
Traffic overload test
App load time/page navigation time tests
Streaming issues/frame rate testing

8. Smart Tv & there O.S ?
Samsung: Tizen OS is known for its simple and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate through apps and settings.
          Tizen is pretty slow. It often takes 2-3 seconds from you touch the remote till something happens on the screen.
LG: LG, another popular brand, utilizes webOS as its smart TV operating system.
    LG’s webOS also has a notable feature called “Magic Remote” which provides voice control and navigation using a simple point-and-click motion.
Sony : Sony smart TVs typically run on Google TV (formerly known as Android TV).

Hisense TVs run on the Roku TV platform, which offers a straightforward and easy-to-use interface. 
        Roku TV features access to thousands of apps and streaming services, including popular platforms like Netflix, YouTube, and HBO Max.
