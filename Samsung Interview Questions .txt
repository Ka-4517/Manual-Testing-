14. What is the difference between UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and System testing?
System Testing: System testing is finding defects when the system undergoes testing as a whole; it is also known as end-to-end testing. 
In such type of testing, the application suffers from beginning till the end.
UAT: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) involves running a product through a series of specific tests which determines whether the product will meet the needs of its users.

15. Mention the difference between Data Driven Testing and Retesting?
Retesting: It is a process of checking bugs that are actioned by the development team to verify that they are fixed.
Data Driven Testing (DDT): In data driven testing process, the application is tested with multiple test data. 
The application is tested with a different set of values.

17. What is the difference between test scenarios, test cases, and test script?

18. What is Latent defect?
Latent defect: This defect is an existing defect in the system which does not cause any failure as the exact set of conditions has never been met

19. What are the two parameters which can be useful to know the quality of test execution?
To know the quality of test execution, we can use two parameters
Defect reject ratio
Defect leakage ratio

21. Explain what Test Deliverables is?
Test Deliverables are a set of documents, tools and other components that have to be developed and maintained in support of testing.
There are different test deliverables at every phase of the software development lifecycle
Before Testing
During Testing
After the Testing

25. What are the categories of debugging?
Categories for debugging
Brute force debugging
Backtracking
Cause elimination
Program Slicing
Fault tree analysis

26. What is fault masking explain with example?
When the presence of one defect hides the presence of another defect in the system, it is known as fault masking.
Example: If the “Negative Value” cause a firing of unhandled system exception, the developer will prevent the negative values input. 
This will resolve the issue and hide the defect of unhandled exception firing.

what is the difference between a project and a product?
The terms "product" and "project" are related to business and management but refer to different concepts:

Product:
- A product is something that is made or grown to be sold or used. It can be a physical item or a service.
- Products are typically designed to meet the needs or wants of customers.
- Products are usually tangible, such as a smartphone, a car, a meal at a restaurant, or intangible, such as software, a music streaming service, or a consultancy service.
- Products have a life cycle that includes development, production, marketing, sales, and eventual retirement.
Project:
- A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.
- Projects are typically time-bound, with specific start and end dates, and are undertaken to achieve a specific goal.
- Projects are usually unique and are not part of the organization's ongoing operations.
- Projects have defined objectives, scope, resources, and timeline.
- Examples of projects include building a new website, launching a marketing campaign, or implementing a new software system.
