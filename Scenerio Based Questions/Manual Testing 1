1. Can you describe your experience with testing software in a real-time environment?
Answer: Sure, I have experience testing software in real-time environments such as financial transaction processing systems (Test in one of my Project). 
These types of systems require testing for high levels of performance, security, and reliability. 
In addition, real-time systems often have strict timing requirements, so testing needs to ensure that the system meets these requirements.

2. How do you ensure that a software application is ready for release to production?
Answer: To ensure that a software application is ready for release to production, I follow a structured testing process that includes functional, performance, security, and regression testing. 
I also work closely with the development team to ensure that all defects have been resolved, and all user requirements have been met. 
Finally, I verify that the system meets all necessary performance and reliability requirements.

3. Can you walk me through a real-world scenario where you found and fixed a critical bug?
Answer: Sure, I once found a critical bug in a financial transaction processing system that caused the system to crash when processing certain types of transactions. 
Also I found a critical bug in my project GetVantage where after applying all available limits in Investor the functionality become null & void in database. (Which is zero limits with zero investment)
I first identified the root cause of the problem by analyzing log files and reviewing the system’s code. 
I then developed a fix and tested it in a staging environment. Once I was confident that the fix worked, I deployed it to the production environment and verified that the system was functioning correctly.

4. How do you prioritize testing efforts when working on a tight schedule?
Answer: When working on a tight schedule, I prioritize testing efforts based on the criticality of the system’s features and functions. 
I focus first on the most critical features and functions and then move on to less critical ones. 
Additionally, I work closely with the development team to ensure that testing efforts are aligned with their development schedule and to ensure that any issues found are addressed in a timely manner.

5. How do you determine which test cases to automate versus manually?
Answer: I determine which test cases to automate versus manually execute based on the frequency of testing, the complexity of the test case, and the likelihood of human error. 
Test cases that are executed frequently and involve complex calculations or data manipulation are good candidates for automation. 
Conversely, test cases that are executed infrequently or involve subjective analysis are better suited for manual execution.

6. Can you explain your approach to performance testing in a real-time system?
Answer: My approach to performance testing in a real-time system involves setting up a test environment that closely simulates the production environment. 
I then create test scripts that simulate realistic user traffic and activity. 
I monitor the system’s performance during testing and use tools such as load testing and stress testing to identify bottlenecks and performance issues. 
Finally, I work with the development team to optimize the system’s performance.

7. What is your experience with testing software that has integrations with external systems?
Answer: I have experience testing software that has integrations with external systems such as payment gateways, shipping systems, and inventory management systems. 
I ensure that the software interacts correctly with these external systems and that data is correctly transmitted and received. 
Additionally, I verify that error handling and recovery processes are in place and that the system can handle unexpected results from external systems.

8. How do you handle unexpected results during testing and what steps do you take to investigate them?
Answer: When unexpected results occur during testing, I first isolate the issue and determine the root cause. (Debugging)
I then work with the development team to develop a fix and test it in a controlled environment. 
Finally, I verify that the fix resolves the issue and that the system is functioning as expected.

9. Can you describe a situation where you found and resolved a critical bug in a real-time system? (Repeat)
Answer: One example of a critical bug I found and resolved was in a stock trading system. 
The bug caused trades to be executed twice, resulting in significant financial losses for the company. 
I identified the root cause of the issue, developed a fix, and tested it in a staging environment before deploying it to the production environment. 
I also implemented additional tests to prevent the issue from occurring in the future.


10. How do you ensure that software is secure and protected from cyber attacks?
Answer: To ensure software is secure and protected from cyber attacks, I conduct security testing to identify vulnerabilities in the software. 
This includes testing for SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and buffer overflows. 
I also ensure that data is encrypted during transmission and storage, and that access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access.


11. Can you describe your approach to testing a mobile application?  [ Important ]
Answer: My approach to testing a mobile application involves testing the application on multiple devices and platforms to ensure compatibility. 
I also test the application’s performance, including load testing and stress testing. 
Additionally, I conduct user acceptance testing to ensure that the application meets user expectations and is user-friendly.
