Finally, I verify that the fix resolves the issue and that the system is functioning as expected.

9. Can you describe a situation where you found and resolved a critical bug in a real-time system? (Repeat)
Answer: One example of a critical bug I found and resolved was in a stock trading system. 
The bug caused trades to be executed twice, resulting in significant financial losses for the company. 
I identified the root cause of the issue, developed a fix, and tested it in a staging environment before deploying it to the production environment. 
I also implemented additional tests to prevent the issue from occurring in the future.


10. How do you ensure that software is secure and protected from cyber-attacks?
Answer: To ensure software is secure and protected from cyber attacks, I conduct security testing to identify vulnerabilities in the software. 
This includes testing for SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and buffer overflows. 
I also ensure that data is encrypted during transmission and storage, and that access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access.


11. Can you describe your approach to testing a mobile application?  [ Important ]
Answer: My approach to testing a mobile application involves testing the application on multiple devices and platforms to ensure compatibility. 
I also test the application’s performance, including load testing and stress testing. 
Additionally, I conduct user acceptance testing to ensure that the application meets user expectations and is user-friendly.


12. How do you ensure that software is accessible to users with disabilities?
Answer: To ensure that software is accessible to users with disabilities, I conduct accessibility testing to identify issues such as insufficient contrast, 
non-standard navigation, and lack of audio descriptions for video content. 
I also ensure that keyboard navigation is available, that text can be resized, and that screen readers can read content correctly.

13. Can you describe your experience with testing software that integrates with third-party APIs?
